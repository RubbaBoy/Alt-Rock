## AlternateRock
[start-desc]: #

This is a repo generated by [Spogit](https://github.com/RubbaBoy/Spogit) and contains a few of my Spotify playlists, with the genre of Alternative or Rock. This repo may be recreated sometime, but is a demo of the functional project.

The reason the playlists aren't directly in this root directory is because it is mirroring a root folder in my Spotify account. Later on I will change it so you can specify non-root folders and playlists to mirror, along with blacklisting certain items.

Anyone can contribute to this via Spogit, more instructions coming soon. Once you set up Spogit though, all you will have to go is `git clone` this repo and everything will be added to your Spotify account.
